  "insights": "Your schedule keeps you largely seated for lectures, creating long stretches of inactivity that can drain daytime energy and reduce alertness. Your training includes cardio work and brief circuit sessions, offering cardiovascular stimulus but the load and cadence may not support robust recovery. Sleep is fragmented and not fully restorative, with interruptions that undermine regeneration and daytime performance. The overall effect is lower energy, uneven recovery, and reduced readiness for demanding tasks.",
  "recommendations": "To better balance exercise and sleep within your fixed schedule, aim for regular, compact movement and cardio and strength work on available windows. Incorporate brief mobility and light conditioning during study breaks and between classes; emphasize proper warm-up and cooldown to protect joints. Choose a simple, progressive mix of cardio tasks such as running or cycling and circuit-style work to support endurance and strength with minimal time. Coordinate with instructors to protect a steady training slot so recovery can be optimized. For sleep, establish a consistent wind-down routine, minimize bright screens before bed, ensure a cool dark environment, and avoid stimulants late in the day. If interruptions persist, practice calm breathing or mindfulness to ease transition to restful sleep and support better recovery.",
  "[short]insights": "Your days are desk-bound with limited movement, causing uneven energy. Sleep is fragmented and recovery is inconsistent, impacting focus.",
  "[short]recommendations": "Introduce compact cardio and strength work and protect recovery. Use breaks for movement and maintain a steady wind down to improve sleep quality."
