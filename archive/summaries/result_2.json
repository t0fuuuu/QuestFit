  "insights": "Daily activity: You spend most of your waking day seated during lectures and screen work, with only sparse movement outside training. This pattern lowers total daily energy expenditure and can dull daytime alertness, making it harder to sustain focus through long sessions. Exercise and cardio: You participate in conditioning workouts and a run, showing you can deliver meaningful cardio effort when scheduled. The uneven distribution creates fluctuating recovery demands, which can influence how well you perform in subsequent cognitive and physical tasks. Sleep: Nightly rest is fair but interrupted, limiting full restoration between days. Variable recovery signals leave you with patchy morning energy and variable daytime readiness. Taken together, the combination of limited daily movement, mixed training loads, and inconsistent sleep can erode steady performance and readiness for both academic and mission tasks.",
  "recommendations": "Recommendations: Working within your schedule, focus on small, consistent gains. Daily activity: add short movement breaks between modules to raise daily activity and sustain alertness. Exercise and cardio: balance sessions so recovery stays in place and cognitive tasks stay manageable. Sleep: keep a fixed wind down routine and minimize late screens to improve restoration. Nutrition and hydration: maintain steady meals and hydration to support energy. This combination should sustain cognitive sharpness, physical readiness, and steadier mood through your cadet program.",
  "[short]insights": "Your days are largely sedentary with sporadic workouts. Sleep is modest and interrupted, impacting daytime focus and recovery. The overall pattern may compromise readiness for cognitive and physical tasks.",
  "[short]recommendations": "Increase short movement breaks between lectures, distribute training to allow full recovery, maintain a consistent bedtime routine, limit late caffeine, and incorporate breathwork to boost sleep quality and daytime alertness."
