  "insights": "Your daily activity is modest given your largely seated, lecture-heavy routine. This level of movement can shape your energy, focus, and stamina during training and operations. In terms of exercise and cardio, you complete a mix of circuit style work, a longer run, and brief conditioning sessions. The running effort stands out as a strong cardio stimulus, which will yield gains if you recover adequately between efforts. Sleep patterns show mixed recovery with interruptions and fragmented cycles, reducing regeneration and potentially affecting mood and daytime performance. Heart rate variability and breathing patterns across sleep suggest alternating periods of restoration and stress, further limiting readiness when sleep is uneven. Given your cadet duties and limited schedule flexibility, prioritizing reliable sleep and integrating small, regular movement bouts will help sustain vigilance, memory, and decision-making during long days.",
  "recommendations": "To improve daily activity under a schedule that emphasizes lectures, incorporate short movement breaks and gentle mobility work between sessions to reduce sedentary time and sustain alertness. For exercise and cardio, balance higher intensity days with adequate recovery, ensure proper warmups and cooldowns, and use your weekly training opportunities to maximize stimulus without accumulating fatigue. For sleep, establish a fixed wind-down routine, minimize late screen exposure, keep your sleep environment cool and dark, and maintain a consistent bedtime to improve sleep continuity, mood, and cognitive readiness.",
  "short_insights": "Daily movement is modest while workouts show mixed intensity. Sleep is fragmented and recovery varies. This pattern can affect daytime alertness and learning. Implement wind-down routines and movement breaks.",
  "short_recommendations": "Boost daily movement with short breaks. Manage cardio by balancing hard days with recovery. Improve sleep hygiene and consistency to support alertness and learning during long lectures."
